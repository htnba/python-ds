Good questions that i must revise:
 ☐ pairwise swap - wihtout changing data
 ☐ Intersection of two Sorted Linked Lists
 ☐ while testing programs, make sure that in case you have two seperate lined lists, you push seperate nodes to them. Leads to a lot of confusion at times.
 ☐ merge sort especially the merge step


Stack:
 ☐ implement k stacks in an array.
 ☐ Stock Span
 ☐
